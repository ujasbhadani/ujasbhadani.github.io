              <p><em>Cloud computing is a booming
technology. There are four types of cloud models available for
use. Such as Community Cloud, Public Cloud, Private Cloud,
Hybrid Cloud. Every organization is moving toward
opensource and cloud computing. Then the question arises,
why don't we apply this method to our Indian education
society? So, this review paper has all answers, including how
you can deploy a hybrid cloud model for your institute. Hybrid
cloud act as a bridge between education society and learners.
It delivers all the required resources to students while
maintaining proper privacy. This article's flow is organized as
follows: Firstly, a brief introduction of cloud computing and its
model, followed by cloud computing in education society,
security algorithms, and finally, deployment of a hybrid cloud.</em></p>

               <h4><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210182">Verizon Telecommunication Network in Boston</a></h4>
              <p><em>Many people believe that the telecoms business is the most profitable sector on the planet. One hundred and ten million homes in the United States have telephones, fifty percent of all households in the United States have access to the internet, and there are over 170 million mobile customers. Since 2004, the annual revenues from long-distance service have been greater than 100 million dollars. The focus of this paper is on the Verizon Telecommunications network in Boston, which is in the United States of America. Verizon Communications Inc. was founded in New York City and incorporated in Delaware. On June 30, 2000, Bell Atlantic Corporation and GTE Corporation merged into a single company. On Monday, July 3, 2000, Verizon shares were first listed for trading under the ticker VZ on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). On March 10, 2010, it also began trading under some other symbol on the NASDAQ exchange. This paper contains a detailed view of telecommunication network nodes deployed in Boston, USA. Some of the essential nodes are deployed with the MBRA tool. In addition, I discussed a high-level understanding of topics like network characterization, the adjacency metric, node degrees, the network degree, link robustness, and the ability to remove links (critical links), the spectral radius, node robustness, the ability to remove nodes, blocking nodes that cannot be removed, node centrality, betweeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality.</em></p>

              <p><em>Electric power networks are now more susceptible to cyberattacks due to their increased interconnectivity and digitization. The security of Smart Grids and the effects of cyberattacks on system functionality and operations are consequently raising concerns. This study addresses the growing concerns regarding the security of Smart Grids and the impact of cyberattacks on their functionality and operations. It provides an in-depth analysis of the various types, frequencies, and consequences of cyberattacks on Smart Grids, as well as their effects on system performance. Additionally, the survey explores a range of defense tactics and strategies that can be employed to mitigate the risk of cyberattacks on these systems. This study offers a thorough assessment of the state of cyber security in Smart Grids today and emphasizes the need for increased awareness and financial support for cyber security measures to safeguard these vital infrastructure components.</em></p>

               <h4><a href="">Pillars of Power System and Security of Smart Grid  </a></h4>
              <p><em>When a complex physical network system and a
cyber network are combined to form a smart grid, numerous

technical challenges arise. The electric power grid’s basic struc-
ture hasn’t evolved in the last century. It has been demonstrated

that the needs of the twenty-first century cannot be met by a
hierarchical, centralized organization. While the information and
communication infrastructure that supports present electricity
systems is strong, the new smart grid requires a separate, much
more complicated infrastructure due to its much larger size.

Smart grids are electric networks that use cutting-edge monitor-
ing, controlling, and communication technology to deliver a safe

and stable energy supply, improve the efficiency of operation for
generators and distributors, and offer consumers various options.
A multipurpose electric power grid system, the smart grid offers
improved efficiency, dependability, and other advantages. This
power system will be improved in order to increase efficiency and
safety, lessen its impact on the environment, and give customers
more control over the network. In this survey report, we will
gain a better understanding and a comprehensive overview of
the concept of the smart grid.

               <h4><a href="">Advanced Email Security with NLP and the Isolation Forest Algorithm </a></h4>
              <p><em>Email security is crucial in today's digital age, as it
serves as the primary means of communication for individuals and
businesses alike. Therefore, it is vulnerable to various cyber
threats like phishing, malware, and spam. These threats can lead
to data breaches, financial losses, and the theft of private
information. This study introduces a comprehensive approach to
detect unusual patterns in emails using artificial intelligence. It
specifically emphasizes the integration of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and the Isolation Forest algorithm. Key
contributions encompass techniques for gathering and organizing
email datasets, the utilization of TF-IDF vectorization to
transform email text into numerical characteristics, the
integration of the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in
email behavior, and the assessment of model effectiveness through
metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC. In
addition, the system demonstrates excellent scalability, flexibility,
and accuracy when it comes to real-world email security scenarios.
This demonstrates the effectiveness of combining natural language
processing (NLP) with machine learning (ML) to enhance email
security and offers a robust solution for detecting and mitigating
cyber-attacks.
